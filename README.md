# Language-detection-in-mixed-language
This NLP project aims to detect and analyze code-mixed text in Indian languages and English, focusing on language identification at the word level. Using machine learning and deep learning, it processes social media posts, chats, and informal text, enabling applications like multilingual sentiment analysis, chatbot development, and content moderation. The project involves dataset collection, text preprocessing, language classification, and evaluation using models like LSTMs, Transformers (mBERT, XLM-R). It contributes to better language understanding in multilingual settings, improving automated translation, speech recognition, and NLP applications for Indian users. A web-based demo or API will be developed for real-time detection.
